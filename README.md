# SpookyPopups
Website I made for Skills Alberta 2023 Competition

Uses HTML and PHP mainly with a little JavaScript.

The website itself is fully functional and allows for the user to view products and their availability. 
There is also a review page where the user can leave a review and it is added to the reviews page through 
displaying from an SQlite database.

The contact form also submits information into a db.

The website uses reflow to show all the products
